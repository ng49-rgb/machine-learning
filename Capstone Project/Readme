# NYC Taxi Trip Duration Prediction üöñ

This repository contains notebooks focused on **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **predictive modeling** for the NYC Taxi Trip Duration dataset.

The main objective is to accurately predict the duration of taxi trips in New York City using engineered features, geospatial data, and advanced regression models.

## üìÅ Repository Contents

### 1. `Copy_of_EDA_+_BEST_MODEL_ONLY.ipynb`
- **Target Variable:** `log_trip_duration`
- Applies a log transformation to improve distribution and model performance.
- Produces the **best fit model** with reduced **MAPE** and minimal underprediction bias.
- Recommended notebook for **final model deployment**.

### 2. `Another_copy_of_EDA_+_BEST_MODEL_ONLY(With_TRIP_DURN).ipynb`
- **Target Variable:** `trip_duration` (original scale in seconds).
- Offers good performance but shows a **slightly higher percentage error**.
- Helpful for interpretation in real-world time units.

### 3. `First_EXECUTION.ipynb`
- Contains **initial EDA**, **baseline models**, and **feature engineering trials**.
- Useful for understanding the **modeling journey and experimentation**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features & Techniques Used

- Geospatial feature extraction (pickup/dropoff distance)
- Time-based features (hour, weekday, month)
- One-hot encoding for categorical variables
- Feature scaling
- XGBoost regression modeling
- Log-transform on skewed target variable
- Model evaluation metrics: MAE, MAPE, R¬≤, RMSE
- Visualization of predictions vs. actuals

## ‚úÖ Goals Achieved

- ‚úî Improved prediction accuracy using log-transformed targets  
- ‚úî Visual validation of under/over-prediction patterns  
- ‚úî Interpretable EDA and clean pipeline for deployment

## üìä Sample Output

- Best model: **XGBoost with log_trip_duration**  
- R¬≤ ‚âà 0.81 | Test MAPE < 20% | RMSE significantly improved
