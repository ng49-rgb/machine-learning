# Customer Segmentation Clustering Projects

Welcome! This repository showcases two end-to-end machine learning projects focused on customer segmentation for online retail. These projects highlight how your choices in data preparation and feature engineering can make or break the quality and meaning of your clusters.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Customer segmentation is a powerful tool in retail analytics, helping businesses understand their audience and tailor their strategies. Here, you'll find two contrasting approaches—one demonstrating common mistakes, the other following best practices for robust, actionable insights.

## 📂 Projects Included

### 1. **Clustering_Project_1st_evaluation**

- **What was done?**
  - Included `CustomerID` as a feature.
  - Did **not** apply NLP to product descriptions.
  - Left the `Country` column unencoded.
- **Approach:** Clustering was performed with identifiers and without text/categorical processing.
- **Key Takeaway:**  
  Including identifiers like `CustomerID` can distort clustering results, leading to meaningless groups based on non-behavioral data. This project serves as a cautionary example—useful for learning about pitfalls in feature selection.

### 2. **Customer_Clustering_Project_Main_Final**

- **What was done?**
  - Removed `CustomerID` before clustering (but saved it separately for mapping results).
  - Applied NLP (Natural Language Processing) to product descriptions for richer feature representation.
  - One-hot encoded the `Country` column.
- **Approach:**  
  Leveraged advanced preprocessing, including text engineering and proper encoding, while keeping identifiers out of the clustering input.
- **Key Takeaway:**  
  This workflow is aligned with industry best practices, producing reliable, interpretable, and actionable customer segments. By retaining `CustomerID` separately, you can link clusters back to real customers—a must for real-world deployment.

## 📝 Usage Guide

- **For learning:**  
  Use `Clustering_Project_1st_evaluation` to understand how poor feature selection can undermine clustering.
- **For real-world solutions:**  
  Use `Customer_Clustering_Project_Main_Final` as your template for best-practice segmentation—reproducible and business-ready.

## 💡 Key Lessons

- **Identifiers like `CustomerID` are for tracking only—never include them in clustering inputs.**
- **Text and categorical features benefit greatly from NLP and encoding.**
- **Thoughtful preprocessing directly improves cluster quality and business value.**
